=head1 NAME

Test::WWW::Mechanize::Object - run mech tests by making
requests on an object

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::WWW::Mechanize::Object;
  my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::Object->new(handler => $obj);
  $mech->get_ok('/foo');
  # use $mech as usual, omitting scheme/host if you want to

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::WWW::Mechanize::Object exists to make it easier to run
tests with unusual request semantics.

Instead of having to guess at which parts of the
LWP::UserAgent and WWW::Mechanize code needs to be
overridden, any object that implements a (relatively) simple
API can be passed in.

All methods from Test::WWW::Mechanize.  The only change is
the addition of the 'handler' parameter to the C<< new >>
method.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 request

  $obj->request($request);

This method receives a L<HTTP::Request|HTTP::Request> as its
only argument.  It should return a
L<HTTP::Response|HTTP::Response> object.  It should not
follow redirects; LWP will take care of that.

This method B<must> exist.

=head2 url_base

=head2 default_url_base

These method should return the current or default base for
request URLs, e.g.

  http://localhost.localdomain (the default default)
  http://myserver.com/myurl

These methods are optional.  They are provided for handler
objects that change their behavior based on some contextual
information (e.g. %ENV).  If this confuses you, you probably
don't need them.

The results of these methods are cached after being called
once, so if your object's return values might change during
program execution, that will not be reflected properly in
Test::WWW::Mechanize::Object.  If this matters to anyone,
send me a bug.

=head2 prepare_request

  $obj->prepare_request($request);

Called before LWP and Mech do all their request object
preparation.

Note: this method will be called once per request in a redirect
chain.

This method is optional.

=head2 before_request

  $obj->before_request($request);

Called after LWP and Mech do their request object
preparation, but before C<< $obj->request >> is called.

Note: this method will be called once per request in a redirect
chain.

=head2 after_request

  $obj->after_request($request, $response);

Called after the object has returned its response, but
before LWP and Mech have done any post-processing.

Note: this method will be called once per request in a redirect
chain.

This method is optional.

=head2 on_redirect

  $obj->on_redirect($request, $response);

Called after C<after_request> each time the object returns a response that is a
redirect (3XX status code). 

This method is optional.

=head1 INTERNALS

You don't need to read this section unless you are
interested in finding out how this module works, for
subclassing or debugging.  Most users will only need to read
the method documentation above.

=head2 new

Overridden to note the 'handler' parameter.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, %arg) = @_;
  my $handler = delete $arg{handler}
    or Carp::croak("the 'handler' argument is required for $class->new()");
  my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%arg);
  $self->{handler} = $handler;
  return $self;
}

sub __hook {
  my ($self, $hookname, $args) = @_;
  return unless my $meth = $self->{handler}->can($hookname);
  $self->{handler}->$meth(@$args);
}

=head2 _make_request

Overridden (from WWW::Mechanize) to call the C<prepare_request> hook.

=cut

sub _make_request {
  my ($self, $request, @rest) = @_;
  $self->__hook(prepare_request => [ $request ]);
  $self->SUPER::_make_request($request, @rest);
}

=head2 get

=head2 head

=head2 post

Overridden (from LWP::UserAgent) to allow path-only URLs to be passed in, e.g.

  $mech->get('/foo', ...);

=cut

  my $self = shift;
  my $url  = shift;

=head2 send_request 

Overridden (from LWP::UserAgent) to send requests to the
handler object and to call the C<before_request> hook.

Note: This ignores the C<$arg> and C<$size> arguments that
LWP::UserAgent uses.

=cut
